Here’s how you can approach it:

1. Check if 2FA is enabled:
Before signing the user in, check if 2FA is enabled for the user. If it is, you'll need to ask for a verification code.

2. Request 2FA code:
If 2FA is enabled, return a response indicating that a second factor is required, without signing the user in yet.

3. Verify 2FA Code (New MFA Endpoint):
You can create a separate endpoint to handle the verification of the 2FA code. Once the user submits the valid code, you can complete the sign-in process by issuing the authentication cookie.




Step 3: Front-End Flow
Step 1: When the user enters their email and password, the SignIn endpoint will return a response indicating if 2FA is required.
Step 2: If 2FA is required, prompt the user to enter their verification code.
Step 3: Send the verification code to the Verify2Fa endpoint.
Step 4: If the code is valid, the user is signed in, and an authentication cookie is issued.
Summary of Flow:
Initial Sign-In Attempt: Check if the user has 2FA enabled.
If 2FA Required: Return a response indicating that the 2FA code is needed.
Submit 2FA Code: Validate the 2FA code using a separate endpoint.
Complete Sign-In: If the code is valid, issue a cookie to sign the user in.
